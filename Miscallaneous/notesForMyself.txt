Transfoers like the bert series typically have 2 parts: a backbone and a head.

The backbone structure of each fine tuned version of the same base model is the same, but the head can be different.

So, when merging you merge the backbone but kekep the heads the same. Since you backpropoagate from the head error for each task, this
is fine.

At inference, you explicitly choose the head corresponding to the task you're doing beforehand.
