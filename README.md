Quantum-Inspired Graph Neural Networks for Blockchain Fraud Detection

📌 Project Summary
This repository implements a quantum-inspired Graph Attention Network (GAT) for blockchain fraud detection. It combines advanced feature mapping, interpretable GNN architectures, and LLM-powered forensic explanations to improve the detection and understanding of illicit transactions in blockchain data.

Future work will expand adversarial evaluation and defense mechanisms for robust, explainable fraud detection in real-world financial systems.

🎯 Motivation
Blockchain systems face evolving security risks, with illicit transactions threatening trust and transparency. Traditional models struggle with complex graph structures and lack interpretability. Our project leverages quantum-inspired features and explainable AI to address these challenges, aiming for safer, more transparent fraud detection.

🧩 Novelty
- Quantum Feature Expansion: Applies random Fourier features to transaction data, mimicking quantum feature maps for richer, non-linear representations.
- Interpretable GNN: Uses GAT to highlight influential nodes and relationships in transaction graphs.
- LLM Forensics: Integrates large language models to generate human-readable explanations for detected fraud cases.

🧠 Methodology
Dataset: Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset (203K+ transactions, 166 features, 234K edges).
Feature Mapping: Expands features using sinusoidal/Fourier transforms.
Model: 2-layer GAT with attention heads, trained on quantum-enhanced features.
Evaluation: Confusion matrix, ROC/AUC, temporal robustness, and forensic explanations.
Pipeline: Modular scripts and notebooks for setup, training, evaluation, and explanation.

Future Work:
- Advanced Feature Engineering: Explore additional quantum-inspired and graph-based features to further boost model accuracy and robustness.
- Model Architecture Optimization: Experiment with deeper GNN architectures, hybrid models, and attention mechanisms to improve detection of complex fraud patterns.
- Enhanced Explainability: Integrate more sophisticated LLMs and visualization tools to make fraud explanations clearer and more actionable for investigators and end-users.
- Benchmarking and Validation: Systematically benchmark the model against industry standards and diverse blockchain datasets to ensure reliability and generalizability.
- Collaborative Defense Strategies: Develop community-driven approaches for sharing fraud patterns and model improvements, enabling rapid adaptation to new threats.
