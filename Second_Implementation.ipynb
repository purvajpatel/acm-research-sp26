Hierarchical Multiscale RNN (HM-RNN) for Ethereum Price Modeling
Author: Shreyaj Padigala
Project: Research implementation of HM-RNN for temporal hierarchy learning
Reference: Chung et al. - Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks

This notebook implements a 3-layer HM-RNN from scratch to predict Ethereum prices.
The model learns hierarchical temporal patterns through explicit COPY, UPDATE, and FLUSH operations.

Data set: Same as implementation #1



Key Findings
Hierarchical Temporal Abstraction

The model successfully learns different timescales across layers
Lower layers operate at finer temporal granularity
Higher layers capture longer-term patterns
Boundary Detection

Binary boundary detectors 
 learned to segment time automatically
Straight-through estimator enables gradient flow despite discretization
Sparsity regularization encourages meaningful segmentation
Operations (COPY / UPDATE / FLUSH)

COPY: Maintains representations when no new information arrives
UPDATE: Integrates information from lower layers via LSTM dynamics
FLUSH: Resets layer state when segment boundary is detected
Price Prediction Performance

Model captures general trends in ETH price movements
Hierarchical structure provides interpretable temporal abstractions
Research-oriented architecture prioritizes clarity over SOTA performance
Limitations
Not designed for production trading (no risk management, execution logic)
Daily frequency may be too coarse for some temporal patterns
Binary boundary detection is discrete (gradient estimation via STE)
Future Work
Experiment with different layer depths and hidden dimensions
Add attention mechanisms for inter-layer communication
Incorporate exogenous features (volume, sentiment, macro indicators)
Analyze learned segments for financial interpretability
